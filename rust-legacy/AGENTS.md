<INSTRUCTIONS>
This directory contains the **legacy** Rust implementation.

Rules:
- Avoid editing files under `rust-legacy/` unless explicitly requested.
- Use this code as a reference for algorithms, ergonomics, and performance ideas only.
- When a component is needed by the new implementation, prefer copying it into `rust/` and then iterating there.
