Procedural macros for rapace RPC framework.

Provides the `#[rapace::service]` macro for:

- **Code generation**: Automatically generates client and server types from trait definitions
- **Type-safe RPC**: Compile-time verification of RPC method signatures
- **Streaming support**: Seamless async stream handling
- **Zero boilerplate**: Write your service interface once, get everything else

This crate is used internally by rapace. Most users will interact through the re-export in the main `rapace` crate.
