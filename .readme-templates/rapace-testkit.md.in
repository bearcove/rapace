Conformance test suite for rapace transports.

Provides comprehensive tests for transport implementations including:

- **Round-trip messaging**: Unary and streaming RPC validation
- **Error handling**: Connection failures and protocol errors
- **Concurrent operations**: Multiple clients and concurrent streams
- **Edge cases**: Large payloads, rapid reconnects, etc.

Use this test suite when implementing new transports or verifying existing implementations.
