Core types and traits for rapace RPC framework.

This crate provides the fundamental types and protocols used by rapace:

- **Transport traits**: Abstraction for different transport implementations
- **Frame formats**: Protocol buffers for RPC messaging
- **RPC session management**: Core session and session pump types
- **Serialization**: Support for multiple serialization formats via facet

This is a low-level crate primarily used by rapace itself and transport implementations.
